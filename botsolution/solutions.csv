4757813,"We are given a particle in uniform circular motion (constant speed, constant magnitude of acceleration) where the instantaneous acceleration is the centripetal acceleration:

\[

In a quarter revolution the velocity direction changes by \(90^\circ\). Suppose the initial velocity is along the positive \(y\)-axis (\(v\,\hat{j}\)) and the final velocity along the negative \(x\)-axis (\(-v\,\hat{i}\)). Then the change in velocity is

4805806,"Step 1: Identifying the heat‐absorbing processes  
The cycle shows that heat is absorbed in two parts: during process A→B (at constant volume) and B→C (at constant pressure).

Step 2: Heat absorbed during A→B  
For a monatomic gas, the molar heat capacity at constant volume is  
\[
C_V=\frac{3R}{2}
\]  
The heat added during a constant volume process is  
\[
Q_{AB}=\mu C_V\Delta T

\[
Q_{AB}=\frac{3}{2}\,(2P_0V_0-P_0V_0)=\frac{3}{2}P_0V_0.

710079,"We start by noting that the mutual inductance is given by

\[
M=\frac{\phi_{12}}{I_1},
\]

where \(\phi_{12}\) is the magnetic flux through the secondary loop (of radius \(R_2\)) due to the current \(I_1\) in the primary loop (of radius \(R_1\)).

For a circular loop carrying current \(I_1\), when \(R_1 \gg R_2\), the magnetic field at the center of the primary loop can be approximated as

\[
B_1=\frac{\mu_0 I_1}{2 R_1}.
\]

Since the secondary loop is very small compared to the primary, we assume that the magnetic field \(B_1\) is nearly uniform over its area. The flux through the secondary loop is then

\[
\phi_{12}=B_1 \times A_2,
\]

where the area of the secondary loop is

\[
A_2=\pi R_2^2.
\]

Substitute \(B_1\) into the expression for \(\phi_{12}\):

\[
\phi_{12}=\left(\frac{\mu_0 I_1}{2 R_1}\right)(\pi R_2^2)=\frac{\mu_0 \pi R_2^2 I_1}{2 R_1}.
\]

Now, substitute this flux into the mutual inductance formula:

\[
M=\frac{\phi_{12}}{I_1}=\frac{\mu_0 \pi R_2^2}{2 R_1}.

Thus, the mutual inductance is directly proportional to

\[
M \propto \frac{R_2^2}{R_1}.

This does not imply that there are absolutely no forces; rather, any forces present balance each other exactly.

Because the image is twice the object’s size, we have

  \[ \frac{|v|}{u} = 2. \]
   
This implies

  \[ |v| = 2u. \]

We are also given that the distance between the object and the virtual image is 45 cm. Since the object lies in front of the mirror and the virtual image (for a concave mirror when the object is inside the focal length) appears behind the mirror, the separation is

  \[ \text{object distance} + \text{image distance (absolute value)} = u + |v| = 45\,\text{cm}. \]

Substitute \(|v|=2u\):

  \[ u + 2u = 45 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad 3u = 45, \]
  \[ u = 15\,\text{cm} \quad \text{and} \quad |v| = 2\times15 = 30\,\text{cm}. \]

Now, using the mirror equation

  \[ \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}, \]
   
we must use the appropriate signs. In the New Cartesian sign convention for mirrors:
• The object distance \(u\) is positive (since the object lies in front);
• For virtual images, the image distance \(v\) is negative.
• For a concave mirror, the focal length \(f\) is positive.

Thus, let

  \[ u = 15\,\text{cm},\quad v = -30\,\text{cm}. \]

Plug these into the mirror equation:

  \[ \frac{1}{-30} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{f}. \]
  
Calculate the left side:

  \[ -\frac{1}{30} + \frac{2}{30} = \frac{1}{30}. \]

Hence,

So, the magnitude of the focal length is 30 cm.

3859666,"We can solve the problem by noting that the small creature is moving with constant speed along a vertical circle. Since the sun’s rays are parallel, the shadow of the creature on the horizontal ground is determined by the projection of the creature’s position onto that plane.

Step 1: Represent the creature's motion along the circle with uniform circular motion. If the creature is at a point along a circle of radius R, its position can be written in terms of the angle \(\theta\) as  
\[
(x,y) = (R\cos\theta, R\sin\theta).
\]

Step 2: The shadow, as the foot of a perpendicular from the creature to the horizontal ground along the direction of the sun’s rays, will have one of its coordinates given by the projection. For an appropriate sun position (for example, if the sun is low in the sky such that the projecting line is along the vertical direction), the horizontal coordinate of the shadow is given by  
\[
x = R \sin\theta.

Since the creature undergoes uniform circular motion, the angle \(\theta\) changes uniformly with time as

  ""Common Mistakes"": ""Students might mistakenly think the shadow moves in a circle or a parabola. They may forget that the sun’s rays are parallel and that the shadow is a projection, not the actual path of the object."",
  ""Explanation for Incorrect Answers"": ""- 'Describes a uniform circle': Incorrect because the shadow is a projection, not the actual object moving in a circle.\n- 'Describes a parabola': Incorrect since the shadow’s horizontal position varies sinusoidally, not quadratically.\n- 'Moves in an irregular way': Incorrect as the motion is regular and predictable, specifically SHM."",
  ""Time Estimate"": ""An average student might take around 5 to 10 minutes to understand and solve this problem."",

3861343,"Step 1: The escape velocity from the Earth’s surface is given by

\[
V_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R_e}}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of the Earth, and \( R_e \) is the radius of the Earth.

Step 2: At a height of \( 7R_e \) above the surface, the distance from the centre of the Earth becomes

\[
r = R_e + 7R_e = 8R_e.
\]

So, the escape velocity from this new position is

\[
V'_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{8R_e}}.
\]

Step 3: Simplify the expression:

\[
V'_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{8R_e}} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{4R_e}}.
\]

Step 4: Express \( V'_e \) in terms of \( V_e \). Since

\[
V_e^2 = \frac{2GM}{R_e},
\]

we can write

\[
\frac{GM}{R_e} = \frac{V_e^2}{2}.
\]

Substitute this into the expression for \( V'_e \):

\[
V'_e = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{V_e^2}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{V_e^2}{8}}.
\]

Step 5: Finally, taking the square root gives

\[
V'_e = \frac{V_e}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{V_e}{2\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, the escape velocity from a height equal to \( 7R_e \) above the Earth's surface is

\[
\boxed{\frac{V_e}{2\sqrt{2}}.}

  ""Explain the problem"": ""The question asks us to find the escape velocity of a body from a point that is at a height equal to 7 times the Earth's radius (7Re) above the Earth's surface. We already know the escape velocity from the Earth's surface (Ve), and we need to calculate how it changes at this higher altitude."",
  ""Concept"": ""The core concept here is escape velocity, which is the minimum speed an object must have to break free from the gravitational attraction of a planet without further propulsion. Escape velocity depends on the distance from the center of the planet—specifically, it decreases as the distance from the center increases."",
  ""Formula"": ""The escape velocity from a distance r from the Earth's center is given by:\n\n\\[\nV_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\( M \\) is the mass of the Earth,\n- \\( r \\) is the distance from Earth's center (Earth's radius plus height above Earth's surface)."",

  ""Hints"": ""Remember that escape velocity depends inversely on the square root of the distance from the center of Earth. Increase in height increases the distance, so the velocity decreases accordingly."",
  ""Tips and Tricks"": ""Instead of recalculating from scratch, express the new escape velocity in terms of the known surface escape velocity to simplify the calculations."",
  ""Common Mistakes"": ""A common mistake is to use the height directly instead of the total distance from the Earth's center; remember to add the Earth's radius to the height before using it in the formula."",
  ""Explanation for Incorrect Answers"": ""Options like \\( \\frac{V_e}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), \\( \\frac{V_e}{2} \\), or \\( \\frac{V_e}{4} \\) do not account correctly for the increase in distance (8 times Earth's radius) and thus yield incorrect values when the formula for escape velocity is applied properly."",
